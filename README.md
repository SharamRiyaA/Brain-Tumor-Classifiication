# Brain Tumor Classification - Naan Mudhalvan Project

This project is developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan** skill development program under the subject **Deep Learning**. It focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and providing predictions through an interactive Gradio interface.

## Introduction

Brain tumor detection and classification from MRI scans is a critical task in medical imaging. In this project, a deep learning model is trained to categorize brain MRI images into four classes: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**. The model is integrated with **Gradio**, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive predictions instantly through a simple web interface.

## Project Structure

* `project2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and Gradio UI integration.
* `README.md` – Project documentation.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning)
* Gradio (Web Interface)
* NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
* Matplotlib (Visualization)

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Google Colab:

   * [Click here to open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SharamRiyaA/Gradio-Brain-Tumor-Classifiication/blob/main/project2.ipynb)

2. Upload the necessary MRI image dataset or connect to Google Drive.

3. Run all cells to train the model and launch the Gradio interface.

4. Use the Gradio interface to upload MRI images and view predictions.

## Future Enhancements

* Improve prediction accuracy with more complex CNN architectures.
* Expand dataset for better generalization.
* Deploy the Gradio app online for global accessibility.
